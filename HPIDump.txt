HPIDump 1.5.1 - HPI File Extract

This program will extract all the files and the directory structure from
the *.hpi and *.ufo files.

The files and directories are created in the current directory.

Command line format:
HPIDump filename.hpi [-o output_directory_name] [-d] [-h] [file1] [file2]

filename.hpi            is the name of the file to extract

output_directory_name   is the optional name of the
                        directory to extract it to.

fileX                   One or more file specifications to extract.
                        Wildcards allowed.

Options:
-h - Print this help message
-d - Detailed output

The program's default behavior is to just extract everything from the
HPI file.

The HPI directory structure will be recreated in the output directory.

The program is a true 32-bit application, so it must run under Win95
(or NT, but I haven't tested that).

It can be used as a direct replacement for WriteHPI, which brings up the
obvious question: Why use this instead of WriteHPI?

It's faster (32 bit code).

It handles long file names, and file and directory names with spaces in
them, gracefully - No _ characters needed.

It will extract files that WriteHPI can't.
(example: the sounds\cdoggy.wav file from totala1.hpi)
